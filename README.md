# Loan approval using Spark
In this small project I try to determine whether a person is eligible to be given loan. To solve this problem I decided to use PySpark on the platform of Databricks, so that i get extra resources. The accuracy of the prediction is still to be finetuned.

Since i was working on Databricks, I only added the notebook to the repository.

## Model & Approach
- Used PySpark for data processing.
- Applied machine learning models such as Logistic Regression.
- Feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning are ongoing.

## Future Improvements
- Improve accuracy through better feature selection and create new variables.
- Test additional machine learning algorithms.
